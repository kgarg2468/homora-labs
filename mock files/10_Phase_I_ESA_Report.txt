EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
==================
Terraverde Environmental Consultants, Inc. (Terraverde) has completed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the subject property in accordance with ASTM Standard Practice E1527-21. This assessment was performed on behalf of Pacific Coast Capital Partners LLC in connection with the potential acquisition of the property.

Based on our investigation, we have identified the following findings:

RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (RECs):
1. Former Dry Cleaning Operation (1965-1987): Historical records indicate that a dry cleaning facility operated at the adjacent property (1860 Gateway Drive) from 1965 to 1987. Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination was documented in soil and groundwater at that site. The plume migration analysis suggests the contamination may extend beneath the southeastern portion of the subject property. Phase II investigation is recommended.

2. Underground Storage Tank (UST): Records indicate a 1,000-gallon heating oil UST was installed on the subject property in 1972 and reportedly removed in 1994. Closure documentation could not be located. Tank location was identified as the northeast corner of the current parking structure footprint.

CONTROLLED RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (CRECs):
1. Regional Groundwater Contamination: The property is located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman (MEW) Superfund Study Area. While the subject property is not a responsible party, groundwater beneath the site may be impacted by the regional trichloroethylene (TCE) plume originating from former semiconductor manufacturing facilities located approximately 0.8 miles north of the property.

HISTORICAL RECs (HRECs):
1. Former Gasoline Service Station: A gasoline station operated at 1870 Gateway Drive (now a landscaped area) from 1952 to 1978. The site received regulatory closure in 2003 following successful remediation.

DE MINIMIS CONDITIONS:
1. Two 55-gallon drums of waste oil were observed in the building's maintenance area. Drums were properly labeled but secondary containment was inadequate.
2. Minor staining observed on concrete flooring in the parking structure (likely automotive fluids).

3.2 LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK (LUST) SITES
The following LUST sites were identified in proximity to the subject property:

Site 1: 1870 Gateway Drive (Former Shell Station)
Distance: 0.03 miles southwest
Case Status: CLOSED (2003)
Contaminants: BTEX in soil and groundwater
Max groundwater concentration: Benzene 450 µg/L (1986)
Remediation: Soil excavation (1,200 cubic yards), groundwater monitoring
Regulatory agency: San Mateo County Health Department
Case closure obtained August 2003 following three years of non-detect groundwater samples.

Site 2: 1860 Gateway Drive (Former Martinizing Dry Cleaners)
Distance: 0.05 miles south (ADJACENT)
Case Status: OPEN - Land Use Restrictions in place
Contaminants: PCE and degradation products in soil and groundwater
Max soil concentration: PCE 8,500 µg/kg at 12 feet bgs
Max groundwater concentration: PCE 1,200 µg/L (1998)
Current groundwater concentration: PCE 85 µg/L (November 2023)
Remediation: Soil vapor extraction (SVE) operated 1999-2008
Current status: Monitored Natural Attenuation with institutional controls
Plume extent: Extends northeast from source area approximately 450 feet

CRITICAL FINDING: Groundwater contamination plume modeling by the Regional Water Quality Control Board indicates the PCE plume from this site may extend beneath the southeastern corner of the subject property. The estimated PCE concentration in this area is 15-40 µg/L based on interpolation from monitoring wells. The Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for PCE is 5 µg/L.

SECTION 5 - FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
=====================================
5.1 RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (RECs)
The following RECs were identified:

REC 1: ADJACENT DRY CLEANER CONTAMINATION
The former Martinizing Dry Cleaners at 1860 Gateway Drive operated from 1965-1987 and is an open contamination case with the Regional Water Quality Control Board. PCE contamination in groundwater has been documented to extend northeast from the source area. Based on plume modeling and the relative positions of existing monitoring wells, there is a reasonable probability that contaminated groundwater extends beneath the southeastern portion of the subject property.

Recommendation: Phase II investigation consisting of the installation of groundwater monitoring wells on the subject property to delineate the extent of the PCE plume.

Estimated Cost: $35,000-$50,000 for two monitoring wells and initial sampling.

REC 2: UNDOCUMENTED UST CLOSURE
Historical records indicate a 1,000-gallon heating oil UST was present on the subject property from approximately 1972 until at least 1976. Visual evidence suggests possible removal circa 1994; however, no closure documentation could be located. The former tank location appears to be beneath the current parking structure.

Recommendation: Submit inquiry to San Mateo County regarding possible closure records. If no records are found, consider Phase II investigation if future construction or excavation is planned in the northeast parking area.

Estimated Cost: $15,000-$25,000 for soil borings if required.

5.2 CONTROLLED RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (CRECs)
CREC 1: REGIONAL TCE PLUME (MEW SUPERFUND)
The property is located within the jurisdictional boundary of the Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman Superfund Study Area. While the subject property is not a responsible party, regional groundwater monitoring indicates TCE impacts may exist in deep groundwater beneath the site. Current land use restrictions prohibit the installation of drinking water wells in this area.

This CREC does not require further assessment but should be disclosed to prospective purchasers and considered in property due diligence.

5.3 HISTORICAL RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (HRECs)
HREC 1: FORMER GAS STATION (1870 GATEWAY DRIVE)
The former Shell gasoline station that operated adjacent to the subject property from 1952-1978 received regulatory closure in 2003. Based on the distance, documented plume extent, and regulatory closure, this site is not expected to impact the subject property.

5.4 DE MINIMIS CONDITIONS
The following de minimis conditions were observed:
- Waste oil drums without secondary containment (maintenance room)
- Minor automotive staining in parking structure

These conditions do not rise to the level of RECs but should be addressed through improved housekeeping practices.

5.5 DATA GAPS
The following data gaps were identified:
- UST closure documentation (1994)
- Pre-1975 building permits
- Interview with former dry cleaning operator

These data gaps do not substantially affect our ability to render an opinion but are noted for completeness.

5.6 OPINION
Based on our assessment, we have identified two RECs associated with the subject property. The more significant concern is the potential extension of PCE-contaminated groundwater from the adjacent former dry cleaner site. We recommend Phase II investigation to characterize this potential liability.
